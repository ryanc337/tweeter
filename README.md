# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository was initially starter code which has been forked from the Lighthouse Labs github.  Since then I have implemented a fully functional front-end using HTML, CSS, JQuery, and AJAX.  Through this project I was able to further develop the fundamentals of front-end JS and experiement with flex-box after initially styling the page with rudimentary CSS.
